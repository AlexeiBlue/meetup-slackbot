# Meetupbot
Meetupbot is a slack chatbot that queries the meetup API for upcoming events

# Running Meetupbot
You can talk to the bot directly, or invite the bot to a channel and invoke the following:
@meetupbot show events

# Limitations
As this is a prototype the only functionality this bot has to list Tech events in Leeds for the next 7 days.  I hope to make this much more configurable in the future.
